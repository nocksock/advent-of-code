# Advent Of Code 2021

https://adventofcode.com/2021

These are my solutions for AOC 2021. I've set myself some limitations:

- no dependencies besides ramda
  - initially I wanted no dependencies whatsoever and write the fp methods
    myself, but I didn't have as much time as I wanted to have.
- vanilla JS only (no babel, no typescript)
- mostly fp approach

`npm start` will run all .js files in the root directory.
